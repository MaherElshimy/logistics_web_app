# LogisticBot üöÄü§ñ

## Project Description

I am excited to share details about LogisticBot, a groundbreaking project developed as part of my Bachelor's degree in Computer and Control Engineering at El Shorouk Academy.

## Project Focus

LogisticBot is a Logistics and Warehouse Automation System designed to enhance efficiency and optimize operations in the logistics industry. Leveraging state-of-the-art technology and automation, the project aims to revolutionize warehouse management.

## Technologies Used

- **Tools:** OpenCV, PostgreSQL, Postman
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Web Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Django
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 for controlling the robot

## Project Highlights

Our automated system features a car with mecanum wheels and a six-degree-of-freedom (6 DoF) robotic arm, offering a comprehensive solution for warehouse tasks.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Product Selection

Users can easily select a product and identify its location within the warehouse, optimizing inventory management.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Line Following and Navigation

The robot employs a line follower mechanism and an AI algorithm based on A* with PID control for precise navigation along predetermined paths.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Camera-based Scanning

Utilizing OpenCV, the system's camera scans the environment, providing accurate coordinates for the targeted product.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Precise Gripping

The robotic arm, equipped with advanced gripping technology, precisely positions the gripper for secure product handling.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Autonomous Delivery

After gripping the product, LogisticBot autonomously moves to the designated delivery point within the warehouse.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Product Release

At the delivery point, the robot gently releases the product, completing the entire automation process seamlessly.

This project showcases our commitment to innovation and the application of cutting-edge technologies in addressing real-world challenges. I look forward to further discussions and collaboration opportunities surrounding LogisticBot.
